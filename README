=================================

A message source provides a set of generic json messages.
Initially this can be sourced from a file, but eventually it could come from a query to psql or Amazon Redshift.
    File contains single JSON source,
    MessageSource trait produces individual messages as JSON Strings,
    FileMessageSource gets messages from file.

Parse messages with play json inception.
    MessageJSONConverter parses message JSON string into Message instances

Define event builders that each know how to combine multiple messages into a single event
(methods: groupByDiscriminator, buildEvent).
    Provide the discriminator function, f, for the standard groupBy function: def groupBy[K](f: (A) â‡’ K): Map[K, List[A]]
    Build an appropriate Event from a sequence of Message.

Convert a sequence of messages into a sequence of events with EventConsolidator, which is provided with a list
of event builders.

Enrich event with info from two services returning futures.

Configure with ReaderT / Kleisli

Display assembled, enriched events with angular, ui-router, ng-table
